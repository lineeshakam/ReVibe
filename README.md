Why Care About Fast Fashion?
- Resorting to fast fashion brands like Shein has become a massive problem, especially with young people: 17% of Gen Z fashion consumers shop at a fast fashion retailer every week, 62% every month. 11.3 megatons of textile waste ends up in landfills every year in the United States, and this issue is even worse world wide, having significant consequences in terms of pollution and unfair labor practices across every continent.
- But yet, despite 94% of Gen Z fashion consumers supporting sustainable clothing shopping, this is not seen in practice.
- It’s obvious that fast fashion is terrible for the environment, and we know it; 94% of Gen Z fashion consumers say they support sustainable clothing shopping
- So why don’t we thrift? Ultimately, some of the major barriers to thrifting include convenience, accessibility to sustainable sources and clothes being worn out or outdated. Another issue is sizing, especially when it comes to online thrift stores. Overall, the common sentiment seemed to be “Wearing thrifted clothing felt more like a compromise than a statement.”

This platform will allow users to explore clothes from their favorite secondhand shopping brands through the filters and features of our app.
- Our tag it right feature uses a Generative AI Tagging system that will tag niche, specific aesthetics that trend on social media and, based on brand, images, and given tags, AI will generate additional tags that help focus the audience and help the product sell. It also It also uses Natural language processing to parse product descriptions and highlights important information that might be hidden in websites like Depop, like flaws/care instructions.
- With our find your size feature, users can input the size of their clothing when they are selling it, or estimate the size if the clothing does not have any tag. AI will look into the brand and track if it typically runs large or small, and notify the buyer or that and provide a “true size”. 
- And finally, create your vibe, using our Neural Network powered recommendations that allow you to swipe through selections and create a feed that truly suits your vibe.

Tech Breakdown
- Generative AI will be utilized to build the tagging system. Through using the internet and social media to find out what types of clothes are trending and what those kinds of clothes look like, the tagging system will use a ChatGPT type of technology to best describe the given article of clothing. It could be anything from business casual to dark academia.
- A natural language processor will be used to create product summaries for the user based on reviews. If there is a common problem, or if a product runs small or large, or if there is something that lots of people really like about the product, the NLP model will pick up on that and include it in a short summary.
- ReVibe becomes personalized through a neural network algorithm that uses training and testing data to learn what a user likes and dislikes. The products a user adds to their cart, saves for later, and how much time they spend looking at the product serves as training data for the algorithm and can then recommend similar products, or products that might go with the given item.
